LIBERTARIAN PATERNALISM
...
The libertarian aspect of our strategies lies in the straightforward insistence that, in general, people
should be free to do what they like - and to opt out of undesirable arrangements if they want to do so.
To borrow a phrase from the late Milton Friedman, libertarian paternalism urge that people should be
'free to choose.' We strive to design policies that maintain or increase freedom of choice. When we
use the term libertarian to modify the word paternalism, we simply mean liberty-preserving. And when
we say liberty-preserving, we really mean it. Libertarian paternalism want to make it easy for people to
go their own way; they do not want to burden those who want to exercise their freedom.
The paternalism aspect lies in the claim that it is legitimate for choice architects to try to influence
people's behavior in order make their lives longer, healthier, and better. In other words, we argue for
self-conscious efforts, by institutions in private sector and also by government, to steer people's
choice in directions that will improve their lives. In our understanding, a policy is 'paternalistic' if it tries
to influence choices in a way that will make choosers better off, as judged by themselves. Drawing on
some well-established findings in social science, we show that in many cases, individuals make pretty
bad decision - decisions they would not have made if they had paid full attention and possessed
complete information, unlimited cognitive abilities, and complete self-control.
Libertarian paternalism is a relatively weak, soft, and nonintrusive type of paternalism because
choices are not blocked, fenced off, or significantly burdened. If people want to smoke cigarettes, to
eat a lot of candy, to choose an unsuitable health care plan, or to fail to save for retirement, libertarian
paternalism will not force them to do otherwise - or even make things hard for them. Still, the approach 
we recommend does count as paternalistic, because private and public choice architects are not
merely trying to track or to implement people's anticipate choices. Rather, they are self-consciously
attempting to move people in directions that will make their lives better. They nudge.
A nudge, as we will use the term, is any aspect of the choice architecture that alters people's behavior
in a predictable way without forbidding any options or significantly changing their economic incentives.
